# TMA-project
Cox_reg = R Markdown code for different cox regressions
Heatmap = tumor metaclusters heatmap and compositions barplot
Simpsons = heterogeneity analyses. Ss-umap = semi-supervised umaps
Survival = Kaplan-Meiers
Objects are used across different codes so it's a mess, but all data needed for these codes is in AFTMA Datacloud (Intermediate files / Data for codes).
They are the same name as in the codes (without the folders).
