# TMA-project
Cox_reg = R Markdown code for different cox regressions (docx is in datacloud).

Heatmap = tumor metaclusters heatmap and tumor/immune/stroma/endothelial compositions barplot.

Simpsons = heterogeneity analyses.

Ss-umap = semi-supervised umaps.

Survival = Kaplan-Meiers.

Objects are used across different codes so it's a bit of a mess, but all data needed for these codes is in AFTMA Datacloud (Intermediate files / Data for codes). They are the same name as in the codes (without the folders).
